* Intellectual property data management and security
  * Experimental data
  * Patient data
* Computational resource availability
  * AI-driven drug development
* Manufacturing automation
* Supply chain security

### **Relevant Threat Trends and Critical Asset Identification**
#### Key Threats Targeting Industry
While biopharmaceutical companies have traditionally experienced cyber attacks frequently due to the valuable and critical services provided, certain companies working on COVID-19 vaccines have experienced a significant uptick in cyber attacks due to the value of the data and desire for knowledge of vaccine details.
**Ransomware Attacks**
* 77% of the total 20 companies examined had unsecured remote desktop protocol (RDP).
* Hacker groups have been targeting companies through ransomware attacks. These attacks rely heavily on exploiting RDP vulnerabilities and phishing.
* Known hacker groups: Maze, Ryuk, Revil/Sodinokibi, Netwalker and Nefilim
**COVID-19 Data Theft**
* Nation-state attacks: Russia, China, Iran and North Korea
**Supply Chain Attacks**
* Americold Logistics LLC vaccine cold-storage breach
#### Cyber Attack Trends
Attacks on the biopharma world are up 200% from 2017 to 2018 and another 50% from 2019 to 2020.

#### Key Industry Assets
1. Raw Materials
Quality raw materials are critical to the production of a reliable, high-quality product. Without a secure supply chain, the quality and confidence in the product would suffer which would affect the millions of potential consumers.
2. Critical Medicine Development/Manufacturing
When critical vaccines and other medicines are crucial to public health such as the COVID-19 vaccines and many other Pfizer products, they need to be reliably manufactured in the numbers necessary to satisfy the consumer base. Due to storage limitations, any halt in production could result in lack of availability. Without sufficient production, availability would be significantly reduced.
3. Patient Confidentiality
Patient confidentiality is of paramount importance. Pharmaceutical industries frequently use human test subjects to assist with confirming the viability and safety of new drugs being introduced into the market. In doing so, they must record private patient data and are then responsible for safeguarding that data. If that data is breached, the patient health information could be used to commit fraud or exploit patient weaknesses.
4. Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is the means by which a company can claim a product as its own and collect revenue on such products. The security of this information is crucial for a company to thrive to allow itself to serve as the sole proprietor of products in which they often have invested greatly. Without significant returns on these investments, companies have difficulty maintaining growth.
5. Public Confidence
Without public trust in a company or product, it is difficult to consistently maintain a solid customer base. The driver of sales of various products in the pharmaceutical industry is the demand by the customers, but if the company is misrepresented or if unfavorable data is leaked as a results of a data breach, public confidence in pharmaceutical products could suffer.
### **Diamond Models**
#### RDP Ransomware

### **Intelligence Buy-In**
The efforts of hacker groups and nation-states to attack pharmaceutical companies working on COVID-19 vaccines has increased dramatically due to the monumental demand, valuable data, and new working conditions.
* The growing number of people working from home has resulted in an increased susceptibility to ransomware attacks through remote desktop vulnerabilities and increased phishing attacks.
* Nation-state attacks have grown due to the desire to learn the trade secrets of Pfizer and other company developments for the COVID-19 vaccine. This provides an opportunity for a nation-state to steal intellectual property to develop and sell their own version of the vaccine or create black market counterfeit vaccines.
* Pharmaceutical and biotech companies suffer more breaches than in any other industries.
* Pharmaceutical companies incur the 4th highest average cost per breach at $5.06M.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56060553/119281558-02959c00-bbeb-11eb-8f63-555ef1476652.png)
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/03/18/how-the-pharmaceutical-industry-can-secure-networks-to-avoid-cyberattacks/?sh=7d7297711eb3

Due to the increasing pharmaceutical industry attacks and high cost per attack, companies are being increasingly motivated to mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks.
* Pharmaceutical companies can no longer tolerate the losses incurred due to significant lost development time.
* Average metrics for pharmaceutical company recovery times:
  * Time Needed to Identify a Breach: **191 days**
  * Time Needed to Contain a Breach: **66 days**
  * Total Recovery Time: **257 days**

Pharmaceutical companies need to take a data-based approach to reduce the time needed to identify that a breach has occurred.
* Intrusion Detection Software
* Employee Security Awareness Training
* Simplified Approach to Security
* Qualified Information Security Experts

## _Milestone 2_

### **CTI Data Source Identification and Justification**
#### AlienVault OTX
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56060553/122377102-9e2fd900-cf19-11eb-81d7-f81abb083eef.png)

https://otx.alienvault.com/
##### _Identification_
* AlienVault OTX (Open Threat Exchange) is a global community in which users generate and publish threat data
  * The threat data can be leveraged efficiently using open-source API to automate security updates and react to known threat indicators
  * OTX pulses provide a threat summary, information on the target, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as (IP address, domains, emails, etc.)
  * Over 19 million threat indicators are generated daily by over 100,000 participants in 140 countries
##### _Justification_
* Through leveraging the DirectConnect API in the company security tools, threats that are targeting the pharmaceutical industry can be exposed early and mitigated against
  * The crowd-sourced approach allows companies to catch and protect against threats early upon community exposure
  * Threat summaries are referred to as “pulses,” and they specify the related IOCs
  * AlienVault OTX is used in approximately 1,049 companies of varying sizes

#### Phishing Database
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56060553/122377529-02eb3380-cf1a-11eb-9f1a-d5c94c067452.png)

Site: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Phishing.Database 
##### _Identification_
* Mitchell Krogza and his team leverage the PyFunceble testing tool to analyze and list active phishing domains:
  * Total Phishing Domains Captured: **306033**
  * Total Phishing Links Captured: **617809**
  * Phishing domains are determined to be active based on HTTP status codes
  * Companies can use this data to filter malicious emails and prevent them from reaching company employees
##### _Justification_
* Phishing is one of the most common ways that malicious actors attempt to exploit a company
* When blacklisting known phishing domains/links, these phishing attacks will not be carried out since it would not reach the intended host
* It is undetermined if companies leverage this specific source of phishing domains/links, but it is likely that some level of phishing prevention is in place for organizations within the pharmaceutical industry due to the cheap implementation and significant threats of exposure/loss when no safeguards are in place

### **Collection Strategies and Data Summary**
**NOTE**: For the purpose of this exercise, the data collected will pertain to the pharmaceutical industry in addition to individual biopharmaceutical companies.
#### AlienVault OTX
##### _Data Collection Methods_
*AlienVault OTX allows for querying pulses/IOCs based on tags and keywords
*For simplicity, we will query the database through the AlienVault OTX webpage for the following keywords: healthcare, financial, defense, and education.
*The number of IOCs for each keyword is indicative of the number of threats exposed to the various industries, and it illustrates the volume of the threats that a pharmaceutical company could likely face.
*This method of data collection is heavily dependent on the summary/tag data

### Relevant Threat Trends and Critical Asset Identification
#### Key Threats Targeting Industry
While biopharmaceutical companies have traditionally experienced cyber attacks frequently due to the valuable and critical services provided, certain companies working on COVID-19 vaccines have experienced a significant uptick in cyber attacks due to the value of the data and desire for knowledge of vaccine details.
**Ransomware Attacks**
* 77% of the total 20 companies examined had unsecured remote desktop protocol (RDP).
* Hacker groups have been targeting companies through ransomware attacks. These attacks rely heavily on exploiting RDP vulnerabilities and phishing.
* Known hacker groups: Maze, Ryuk, Revil/Sodinokibi, Netwalker and Nefilim
**COVID-19 Data Theft**
* Nation-state attacks: Russia, China, Iran and North Korea
**Supply Chain Attacks**
* Americold Logistics LLC vaccine cold-storage breach
#### Cyber Attack Trends
Attacks on the biopharma world are up 200% from 2017 to 2018 and another 50% from 2019 to 2020.

#### Key Industry Assets
1. Raw Materials
Quality raw materials are critical to the production of a reliable, high-quality product. Without a secure supply chain, the quality and confidence in the product would suffer which would affect the millions of potential consumers.
2. Critical Medicine Development/Manufacturing
When critical vaccines and other medicines are crucial to public health such as the COVID-19 vaccines and many other Pfizer products, they need to be reliably manufactured in the numbers necessary to satisfy the consumer base. Due to storage limitations, any halt in production could result in lack of availability. Without sufficient production, availability would be significantly reduced.
3. Patient Confidentiality
Patient confidentiality is of paramount importance. Pharmaceutical industries frequently use human test subjects to assist with confirming the viability and safety of new drugs being introduced into the market. In doing so, they must record private patient data and are then responsible for safeguarding that data. If that data is breached, the patient health information could be used to commit fraud or exploit patient weaknesses.
4. Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is the means by which a company can claim a product as its own and collect revenue on such products. The security of this information is crucial for a company to thrive to allow itself to serve as the sole proprietor of products in which they often have invested greatly. Without significant returns on these investments, companies have difficulty maintaining growth.
5. Public Confidence
Without public trust in a company or product, it is difficult to consistently maintain a solid customer base. The driver of sales of various products in the pharmaceutical industry is the demand by the customers, but if the company is misrepresented or if unfavorable data is leaked as a results of a data breach, public confidence in pharmaceutical products could suffer.
### Diamond Models

### Intelligence Buy-In
The efforts of hacker groups and nation-states to attack pharmaceutical companies working on COVID-19 vaccines has increased dramatically due to the monumental demand, valuable data, and new working conditions.
* The growing number of people working from home has resulted in an increased susceptibility to ransomware attacks through remote desktop vulnerabilities and increased phishing attacks.
* Nation-state attacks have grown due to the desire to learn the trade secrets of Pfizer and other company developments for the COVID-19 vaccine. This provides an opportunity for a nation-state to steal intellectual property to develop and sell their own version of the vaccine or create black market counterfeit vaccines.
* Pharmaceutical and biotech companies suffer more breaches than in any other industries.
* Pharmaceutical companies incur the 4th highest average cost per breach at $5.06M.

Due to the increasing pharmaceutical industry attacks and high cost per attack, companies are being increasingly motivated to mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks.
* Pharmaceutical companies can no longer tolerate the losses incurred due to significant lost development time.
* Average metrics for pharmaceutical company recovery times:
  * Time Needed to Identify a Breach: **191 days**
  * Time Needed to Contain a Breach: **66 days**
  * Total Recovery Time: **257 days**

Pharmaceutical companies need to take a data-based approach to reduce the time needed to identify that a breach has occurred.
* Intrusion Detection Software
* Employee Security Awareness Training
* Simplified Approach to Security
* Qualified Information Security Experts
